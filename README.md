### Concurrency sample for Java EE7

This application on demonstrates how to use managed executors, managed scheduled executors and context service to perform tasks in parallel in a simple application.

### WAS Liberty
#### Running with Maven

The sample can be built usingÂ Apache Maven. In the directory where you cloned the repository issue the following command to build the source.

  `$ mvn install`

Then, in the same directory issue the following command to run it on a Liberty server.

  `$ mvn liberty:run-server`

You can connect to the application at [http://hostname:port/sample.javaee7.concurrency/ConcurrencySample](http://hostname:port/sample.javaee7.concurrency/ConcurrencySample).

#### Running in Eclipse/WDT with Maven

The WebSphere Development Tools (WDT) for Eclipse can be used to control the server (start/stop/dump/etc.), it also supports incremental publishing with minimal restarts, working with a debugger to step through your applications, etc.

WDT also provides:

- content-assist for server configuration (a nice to have: server configuration is minimal, but the tools can help you find what you need and identify finger-checks, etc.)
- automatic incremental publish of applications so that you can write and test your changes locally without having to go through a build/publish cycle or restart the server (which is not that big a deal given the server restarts lickety-split, but less is more!).

Installing WDT on Eclipse is as simple as a drag-and-drop, but the process is explained on [wasdev.net](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).

#### Import project and running in Eclipse/WDT:

1.	Select menu File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.
2.	Select Browse... to the top level directory titled sample.javaee7.concurrency and select Finish
3.	Click Yes to the WebSphere Liberty dialog to automatically create server in the Servers view for this project.
4.  Right-click the project and select Run As > Run on Server.
5.  Select the server and click Finish.
6.  Confirm web browser opens with the sample url, [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.concurrency/](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.concurrency/).


### WAS Classic

Configure required resources

1.	Verify that a Derby JDBC Provider instance exists. In the administrative console, click Resources > JDBC > JDBC providers.
  - If that provider does not exist, create one with a Connection pool datasource implementation type, and point to the Derby.jar file; for example: ${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/derby/lib

2.	Verify that a Default datasource instance is configured. Click Resources > JDBC > Data sources.
  - If that datasource does not exist, create one with the name "Default datasource" and the JNDI name "DefaultDatasource" that points to the Derby JDBC Provider and "${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/derby/DefaultDB" database.
  - To create the actual database, remotely connect to your machine hosting WebSphere Classic using SSH.
    - Navigate to ${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/derby/bin/embedded/
    - Run "./ij.sh". When you see the prompt "ij>", enter the following command:
        $ connect 'jdbc:derby:DefaultDB;create=true';
    - The default Derby database is created in the following directory: ${WAS_INSTALL_ROOT}/derby/DefaultDB

#### Install using wsadmin tool

1. Start wsadmin tool with Jython option 
2. Run command 
`AdminApp.install('<path-to-the-app>/sample.javaee7.concurrency.war','[-node <your-node-name> -server <your-server-name> -appname sample.javaee7.concurrency -contextroot sample.javaee7.concurrency -MapWebModToVH [[ sample.javaee7.concurrency sample.javaee7.concurrency.war,WEB-INF/web.xml default_host ]] -MapResEnvRefToRes [[ sample.javaee7.concurrency "" sample.javaee7.concurrency.war,WEB-INF/web.xml com.ibm.ws.samples.concurrency.ConcurrencySampleServlet/contextService javax.enterprise.concurrent.ContextService wm/default ][ sample.javaee7.concurrency "" sample.javaee7.concurrency.war,WEB-INF/web.xml com.ibm.ws.samples.concurrency.ConcurrencySampleServlet/executor javax.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedScheduledExecutorService wm/default ]]]' ) `

3. Save configuration 

#### Install using the Administrative Console

1.	In your preferred browser, go to the Integrated Solutions Console; for example: [http://hostname:9060/ibm/console/]
(http://hostname:9060/ibm/console/)
2.	Log in with your user name and password.
3.	Select Applications > New Application.
4.	Select the New Enterprise Application link.
5.	Using the Local file system option, click Browse, and select the war file that you built using Maven.
6.	Click Next to follow the wizard using the default options, until the Finish button is displayed.
7.	When the Confirm changes section is displayed, click Save.
8.	Click Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications.
9.	Select the check box next to the sample application, and click Start.
